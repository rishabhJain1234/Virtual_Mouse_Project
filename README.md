# AI Virtual Mouse Using Hand Gesture Recognition

## Why do we use the virtual mouse?
The proposed AI virtual mouse system can be used to overcome problems in the real world such as situations where there is no space to use a physical mouse and also for persons who have problems in their hands and are not able to control a physical mouse. Also, amidst the COVID-19 situation, it is not safe to use the devices by touching them because it may result in a possible situation of the spread of the virus by touching the devices, so the proposed AI virtual mouse can be used to overcome these problems since hand gestures and hand Tip detection is used to control the PC mouse functions by using a webcam or a built-in camera.

## Algorithm Used for Hand Tracking
For the purpose of detecting hand gestures and hand tracking, the MediaPipe framework is used, and the OpenCV library is used for computer vision. The algorithm makes use of machine learning concepts to track and recognize hand gestures and hand tips.

## Major applications:
(I) The proposed model has a greater accuracy of 99% which is far greater than that of other proposed models for virtual mice, and it has many applications<br>
(ii) Amidst the COVID-19 situation, it is not safe to use the devices by touching them because it may result in a possible situation of spread of the virus by touching the devices, so the proposed AI virtual mouse can be used to control the PC mouse functions without using the physical mouse<br>
(iii) The system can be used to control robots and automation systems without the usage of devices<br>
(iv) 2D and 3D images can be drawn using the AI virtual system using the hand gestures<br>
(v) AI virtual mouse can be used to play virtual reality- and augmented reality-based games without the wireless or wired mouse devices<br>
(vi) Persons with problems in their hands can use this system to control the mouse functions in the computer<br>
(vii) In the field of robotics, the proposed system like HCI can be used for controlling robots<br>
(viii) In designing and architecture, the proposed system can be used for designing virtually for prototyping<br>

## Conclusions
From the results of the model, we can come to the conclusion that the proposed AI virtual mouse system has performed very well and has greater accuracy compared to the existing models, and also the model overcomes most of the limitations of the existing systems. Since the proposed model has greater accuracy, the AI virtual mouse can be used for real-world applications, and also, it can be used to reduce the spread of COVID-19, since the proposed mouse system can be used virtually using hand gestures without using the traditional physical mouse.
